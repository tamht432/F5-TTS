The weak flesh had been purged to clear a path for the perfect machine of war." }, { "id": 69, "script": "A similar logic, though born of a different, stoic philosophy, resides within the hearts of the sons of Rogal Dorn, the defenders of Terra, the Imperial Fists." }, { "id": 70, "script": "To an Imperial Fist, the fortress is everything. The wall, the bastion, the defensive position—these are not mere structures of stone and steel; they are sacred symbols of Mankind's endurance, physical manifestations of humanity's unyielding will to survive. They will die to defend a wall. And they will, without a moment's hesitation, allow you to die to defend it." }, { "id": 71, "script": "During the infamous Siege of Hydra Cordatus, a massive Iron Warriors warband, the ancient and bitter rivals of the Fists, laid siege to their fortress-monastery. Millions of Planetary Defense Force troopers and hastily conscripted civilian militia fought and died alongside the one hundred Astartes present. As the battle turned against them, an outer defensive ring, manned primarily by mortals, collapsed under a brutal traitor artillery barrage. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and support staff were trapped in the no-man's-land between the fallen outer wall and the main citadel, facing certain slaughter at the hands of the advancing Traitor Legion." }, { "id": 72, "script": "They hammered on the colossal plasteel gates, their cries for salvation echoing across the battlements, a desperate symphony of terror. The Imperial Fists commander, the legendary Captain Darnath Lysander, stood upon the wall and watched the slaughter unfold. His Sergeants looked to him, awaiting the order. To open the gate, even for a moment, would create a breach, a single point of weakness that the enemy's siege masters would exploit with merciless, mathematical precision. It was an unacceptable risk." },{ "id": 73, "script": "...Hold the gate,... his command came over the vox, his voice as solid and uncompromising as the adamantium beneath his feet. ...There are no exceptions. The fortress endures...." }, { "id": 74, "script": "The men and women outside were butchered. They were cut down by bolter fire, crushed by daemon engines, and rendered down into screaming slurry by chem-weapons. Their screams were a soundtrack to the siege for hours. To the Imperial Fists, it was a regrettable but necessary noise. They took no pleasure in the deaths, but they felt no hesitation, no remorse. For in their calculus, the structural and symbolic integrity of the fortress was of infinitely greater value than the lives of those who could not be protected within it. The wall must hold, no matter the cost in blood." }, { "id": 75, "script": "Tool. Bait. Obstacle. Sacrifice. In the eyes of these pragmatic Angels of Death, a civilian can be anything at all, except, perhaps, an equal, a fellow human being worthy of consideration beyond their immediate tactical value." }, { "id": 76, "script": "But there are Chapters who go further still. Chapters whose logic has been so twisted by war and bitterness that they no longer see civilians as a variable in an equation. To them, you are an annoyance. A waste of resources. You are prey." }, { "id": 77, "script": "If there is a fine, sacred line drawn between the noble protector and the slavering monster he is sworn to fight, there are Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes who have scoured that line away with bolter shells and promethium. For these warriors, the cold pragmatism of their cousins has curdled into something far darker. Contempt for the perceived weakness of the common man has festered into open, active hostility. Their arrival on a battlefield is often a curse, not a blessing, a second front opened against the very people they are nominally there to save. They are the Emperor's wrath made manifest, a fury so uncontrollable, so utterly devoid of compassion, that it consumes all in its path. They are fallen angels, draped in the blood-soaked trappings of loyalty." }, { "id": 78, "script": "And no example is more stark, more infamous, in the bloody annals of the Imperium, than the Chapter known as the Marines Malevolent." } ,
  { "id": 79, "script": "Their very name is a declaration of intent, a sneer made manifest in High Gothic. The ...Malevolent Marines.... They are a Chapter steeped in bitterness and unending, grinding war, fighting on the most brutal fronts for millennia without respite. This endless conflict has stripped them of all but the most cynical and brutal aspects of their duty. They believe that any who are not strong enough to save themselves, any who require the intervention of the Astartes, are unworthy of that salvation. They fight not for the abstract ideal of humanity, but for the visceral, blood-pounding thrill of the fight itself, and for the spoils of war they believe are their due. To them, civilians are weakling maggots, a mewling tide of useless flesh that is always in the way, always crying for aid, always wasting precious ammunition and time that could be better spent killing the enemy." }, { "id": 80, "script": "Their most notorious act of barbarism, an event that has been officially censured by the High Lords of Terra and condemned by a dozen other Chapters, occurred during the Third War for Armageddon. This single event perfectly encapsulates their entire philosophy. At the Sanctuary of St. Capilene, a hastily erected refugee camp outside the besieged Hive Kora, millions of displaced citizens had gathered. They were a sprawling, desperate city of tents, makeshift shelters, and raw, naked fear, hoping for protection from the green tide. But a small cadre of elite Ork Kommandos, cunning and cruel, had infiltrated the camp under the cover of the chaos, using the terrified masses as a perfect, living shield from which to launch harassing attacks." }, { "id": 81, "script": "Any other Chapter, even the most pragmatic, would have attempted a solution. A surgical strike by veteran squads. A stealthy deployment of scout assets to identify and eliminate the Orks. Even the Iron Hands might have calculated the most efficient way to neutralize the threat with minimal waste of their own resources. The Marines Malevolent chose a different, more direct solution." }, { "id": 82, "script": "Their commander at the time, the odious Chapter Master Vaylund Cal, observing the situation from the command deck of his strike cruiser, the Harbinger of Spite, made a simple tactical decision. He deemed the risk of inserting his Astartes into the chaotic, civilian-clogged camp to be an unacceptable hazard to his warriors. He deemed the civilians themselves to be collaborators, their weakness having allowed the Orks to infiltrate. He therefore designated the entire camp, a zone containing over two million desperate souls, as a legitimate military target." }, { "id": 83, "script": "He ordered his Thunderhawk gunships to open fire. Not on the suspected Ork positions. On the entire camp. Indiscriminately. Without warning. A storm of hellstrike missiles and heavy bolter fire rained down upon the defenseless. Tents, medical stations, and food distribution centers were obliterated in blooms of fire and shrapnel. Thousands of refugees were incinerated in moments alongside the handful of Orks they were unknowingly shielding. The ground was turned into a scorched, bloody mire." }, { "id": 84, "script": "When confronted later by a horrified Chaplain of the Salamanders Chapter, the noble Harath Shen, who had witnessed the atrocity, Vaylund Cal gave his now-infamous reply, a statement that has echoed through the halls of the Inquisition and the records of the Astartes for centuries. He looked upon the burning field of the dead and said, with no hint of remorse, ...Their lives were not strategically viable...." }, { "id": 85, "script": "But the atrocity did not end with the bombardment. After the fires had begun to die down, the Marines Malevolent landed in the smoldering ruins. They did not come to aid the wounded, who numbered in the tens of thousands. They did not come to search for survivors trapped in the wreckage. They came to scavenge." }, { "id": 86, "script": "They moved through the carnage with cold, methodical purpose, their yellow and black armor a sickening counterpoint to the grey ash and red blood. They systematically stripped weapons, ammunition, med-kits, and rations from the dead and the dying. Anya witnessed them tear a lasgun from the hands of a wounded PDF trooper, leaving him to bleed out. They stormed makeshift medical tents, pushing aside screaming medicae to confiscate precious supplies of synth-skin and pain suppressants. They claimed, to any who dared protest, that these resources were wasted on the weak and would be put to better use in the holy hands of the Adeptus Astartes. They left thousands of wounded to die in agony, having robbed them of their last, desperate means of defense or succor." }, { "id": 87, "script": "To the Marines Malevolent, a civilian is not just worthless; they are a resource to be plundered, a field to be harvested after the battle. They are vultures in power armor, and your life is valued only by what they can strip from your cooling corpse. Theirs is a conscious, philosophical cruelty, a deliberate choice to place their own needs and their own twisted sense of superiority above the lives of those they are sworn to protect." }, { "id": 88, "script": "But such brutality can stem from more than just a corrupted philosophy. Sometimes, it is a curse of the blood, a tragic, inescapable flaw in the very core of their being, a madness that can turn a noble hero into a slavering beast in the blink of an eye. For this, we must look to the tragic sons of the Angel, the Primarch Sanguinius, and specifically, to their most ferocious and feared successors, the Flesh Tearers." }, { "id": 89, "script": "Led by the grim and perpetually furious Chapter Master Gabriel Seth, the Flesh Tearers are renowned for their martial prowess and their utter, terrifying savagery in close combat. They carry within their gene-seed two genetic curses, the Red Thirst and the Black Rage. The Thirst is a constant, gnawing desire for blood, a craving that can only be held in check by immense willpower and ritual. But it is the Black Rage that is their true damnation. It is a psychic echo of their Primarch's death, a psychic wound that has festered for ten thousand years. When the Black Rage takes them, a Space Marine loses his mind, his identity, his very sanity. He is cast back ten thousand years in time, living out the final, desperate hours of the Siege of Terra at his father's side. In his eyes, the universe melts away, replaced by the fire-swept battlements of the Imperial Palace. Everyone—friend, foe, and innocent bystander—becomes a daemon, a traitor, a monster to be slain in the name of the dying Angel." }, { "id": 90, "script": "For a civilian, there can be no greater, more arbitrary horror than to be ...rescued... by a squad of Flesh Tearers lost to the Rage." }, { "id": 91, "script": "Imagine a small agri-settlement on the feudal world of Baalfora. You are a farmer named Pella, hiding in the root cellar of your homestead with your two young sons. Outside, the night is filled with the shrieks and laughter of a Drukhari raiding party. They are taking your neighbors, their screams fading into the darkness. You clutch your sons close, praying to the Emperor for a swift, merciful end. And then, your prayer is answered, but in the cruelest way imaginable. You hear a new sound cutting through the terror: the roar of jump packs, the thunder of bolter fire, and the high-pitched, mechanical scream of chainswords. Deliverance has come." }, { "id": 92, "script": "The cellar door is torn from its hinges, not by an alien, but by a giant in blood-red armor. He is a whirlwind of destruction. The Drukhari who had been about to discover you is bisected in a spray of purple blood. The Astartes, and his brothers, clear the village in minutes, a force of such incredible, focused violence that the xenos raiders are utterly annihilated. The battle is over. You are saved." }, { "id": 93, "script": "You step out of the cellar, tears of gratitude streaming down your face, pulling your sons behind you. You mean to thank them, to offer them what little you have. But then you see their eyes. They are not the eyes of saviors. Through the visors of their helmets, you see a madness, a rage so profound it seems to warp the very air around them. There is no recognition there. No reason. Only a pure, undiluted, ancient fury." }, { "id": 94, "script": "To the warrior before you, the hero who just saved your life, you are not a grateful farmer. His mind has snapped. In his eyes, you are a gibbering daemon of Chaos upon the burning walls of the Emperor's Palace. He sees the pitchfork in your hand not as a farming tool, but as a rusted blade wielded by a traitor. He sees your sons not as terrified children, but as twisted, malevolent imps cavorting at the feet of a heretic. He roars a name that is not yours, a name that echoes with ten thousand years of grief and hatred—...HORUS!...—and his roaring, blood-slick chainsword descends." }, { "id": 95, "script": "The rage of the Flesh Tearers is a tragedy of a scale few can comprehend. They do not wish to slaughter the innocent. Chapter Master Seth himself fights a constant, desperate battle to rein in the worst excesses of his Chapter, to direct their fury only at the enemy. But the flaw in their blood is a ravenous beast, and on the battlefield, it often breaks its chains. They are the Emperor's rabid dogs, loyal to the very last, their courage and martial pride beyond question, but they are too damaged, too dangerous to ever truly be trusted. Their protection is a double-edged blade, a promise of salvation that is just as likely to cut you down as it is your enemy." }, { "id": 96, "script": "From the willfully malevolent who choose cruelty as their creed, to the tragically insane who are slaves to their own cursed blood, these Chapters represent the darkest, most terrifying truth of the Adeptus Astartes. That sometimes, the monsters created to fight the monsters of the galaxy... become monsters themselves, different only in the color of their armor and the name of the master they serve." } ,
 { "id": 97, "script": "So, we return to the fundamental, terrifying question. How do the Adeptus Astartes, the Angels of the Emperor, truly treat the civilians they are sworn to protect?" }, { "id": 98, "script": "They treat you as a precious child, a sacred ward to be shielded from the darkness with the very fiber of their being, a life worthy of their own ultimate sacrifice." }, { "id": 99, "script": "They treat you as a pawn in a vast, unknowable game of cosmic chess, a piece to be positioned, defended, or sacrificed for a strategic advantage you can never hope to comprehend." }, { "id": 100, "script": "They treat you as an inconvenient obstacle, a biological malfunction in the otherwise perfect machine of war, a problem to be solved with overwhelming and dispassionate force." }, { "id": 101, "script": "They treat you as an insignificant insect beneath their iron heel, a source of irritation or, worse, a resource to be plundered from the battlefield like any other spoil of war." }, { "id": 102, "script": "They treat you as a phantom, a ghost from a past they no longer recognize, a heretic or a daemon seen through the red haze of a ten-thousand-year-old madness." }, { "id": 103, "script": "All of these are true. The answer is not a single, simple statement. It is a horrifying, contradictory mosaic, a spectrum of behavior that ranges from the heights of selfless nobility to the very depths of depravity. The answer lies not in a single Chapter or a single act, but in the brutal, multifaceted, and schizophrenic nature of the Imperium itself in the 41st Millennium." }, { "id": 104, "script": "The truth is, the way a Space Marine treats you speaks more to their nature than it does to yours. They are living weapons, forged for an age of unending, unimaginable war. They are boys taken from their families, subjected to brutal psycho-conditioning, arcane science, and relentless hypno-doctrination. Their minds and souls are forever altered, their emotional capacity systematically blunted, their perspective stretched across centuries of bloodshed. They are divorced, by design, from the very humanity they are sworn to protect, lest empathy for the individual compromise the survival of the species." }, { "id": 105, "script": "They are demigods, yes, but they are also damaged goods. Each Chapter is a reflection of its Primarch, its history, its triumphs, and its traumas. A Salamander's compassion is a reflection of Vulkan's deep love for humanity. An Imperial Fist's stubborn defense of a fortress is a reflection of Rogal Dorn's unyielding nature. And a Flesh Tearer's madness is the eternal, screaming echo of Sanguinius's final agony. They are not a monolith. They are a thousand different brotherhoods, each with its own culture, its own rituals, and its own unique interpretation of what it means to serve the Emperor." }, { "id": 106, "script": "And that service is the key. They do not serve you. They do not serve your governor, your world, or your way of life. They serve the Emperor, and through Him, the abstract, galaxy-spanning concept of Humanity. And if the survival of that abstract concept requires the sacrifice of you, your family, your city, or your entire world, it is a price that nearly every single one of them is prepared, and has been conditioned, to pay without a moment's hesitation." }, { "id": 107, "script": "The Emperor's protection is real. It is not a myth. It exists in the form of these armored giants, in the roar of a bolter and the shadow of a battle barge. But it is not a benevolent, comforting protection. It is a fortress wall built of bone and mortared with the blood of countless, forgotten individuals. It is a surgeon's knife that carves out the cancerous tumor by cutting deep into healthy, screaming flesh. It is the terrible choice, offered to you without your consent, between a swift, violent end at the hands of a xenos or a heretic, and a prolonged, uncertain existence under a regime that considers your life to be utterly, completely expendable." }, { "id": 108, "script": "The story of Vex Torion is not an anomaly. It is the rule, written in the blood and tears of a million worlds across ten thousand years. The continued, miraculous survival of the human race in this hostile, unforgiving galaxy is built upon a foundation of such horrific, pragmatic sacrifices, on truths so terrible that they must be buried under mountains of lies and millennia of silence." }, { "id": 109, "script": "And perhaps the most terrifying part of all… the part that keeps the High Lords of Terra awake in their stasis chambers at night… is that it works. This brutal calculus, this willingness to sacrifice the few to save the many, is the only reason humanity still exists at all. It is the terrible, bloody price of survival." }, { "id": 110, "script": "So when you see the shooting stars of iron and fire descending from your sky, you may pray. You may hope. You may offer thanks to the God-Emperor for your deliverance. But you must also understand that the beings who step from those pods are not there to save you. They are there to win. And in the 41st Millennium, there is a vast and terrible difference between the two." },
  { "id": 111, "script": "This brutal calculus… this spectrum of compassion and cruelty… this entire, fractured philosophy of the Adeptus Astartes… it all stems from the doctrines and the genetic legacies of the demigods who sired them: the Primarchs." }, { "id": 112, "script": "For ten thousand years, those Primarchs have been figures of myth and legend. Martyrs, traitors, or absent gods. Their teachings have been interpreted, dogmatized, twisted, and misunderstood by a million different mouths in a million different ways. The sons have carried on the war in the long, dark absence of their fathers." }, { "id": 113, "script": "But now, the impossible has happened. The age of myth is ending. An age of action has begun." }, { "id": 114, "script": "One of them has returned from the precipice of death. A father has come home to a house in ruins, to see what his warring, traumatized sons have become. A Primarch, a being of unimaginable power and intellect, now holds the fate of the entire, shattered Imperium in his gauntleted hands." }, { "id": 115, "script": "He is the master strategist. The author of the Codex Astartes. The Lord of Macragge. The last, best hope for a dying empire." },
{ "id": 116, "script": "But is he a savior, the guiding light who will finally lead humanity out of the darkness and forge a new, brighter future? Or is he merely the ultimate pragmatist, the architect of a more efficient, more orderly, more all-consuming slaughterhouse, destined only to preside over the managed decline of the human race?" }, { "id": 117, "script": "In our next chronicle, we journey from the trenches to the throne. We delve into the mind of the Avenging Son himself… Roboute Guilliman." }
